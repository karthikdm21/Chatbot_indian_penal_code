This is a Conversational AI Chatbot built using LangChain, Ollama, and Streamlit, designed to answer questions about the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The chatbot loads a PDF document, splits it into smaller chunks,
embeds the text for similarity-based retrieval, and provides answers based on the most relevant context.

The chatbot operates using Conversational Retrieval Chain (CRC), which helps in answering queries while maintaining context throughout the conversation.
It utilizes Ollama LLM and DeepSeek-r1:1.5b for embedding and generating responses.

This program was developed during our workshop, and it was really fun working on it! We got hands-on experience with Generative AI,
building an AI-powered legal assistant, and exploring how document-based chatbots can be implemented in real-world applications.
